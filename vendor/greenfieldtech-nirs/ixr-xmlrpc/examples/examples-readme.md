==========
The following example illustrates the two sides of XML-RPC, the server and the client. This examples directory is a work in progress and will contain additional examples as we progress.
Installation of the example should be performed as following (assuming you are using a CentOS/RedHat distribution):

1. Copy the examples to a designated directory on your web server
2. Use composed to install the library to your web servers' designated directory
3. Use a web browser to browse the xmlrpc-server.php file - you should be greeted with an error message
4. Now, user a web browser to browser the xmlrpc-client.php file - you should now see the client at work
